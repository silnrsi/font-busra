# font-busra
Upcoming font family for the Khmer script, based on the Mondulkiri family of fonts (https://software.sil.org/mondulkiri/). Please do not use this project as the basic for derivative fonts, as it is still a work in progress. 

The Latin glyphs are only temporary and will be replaced soon.
