<h2>Busra—an updated version of a popular Khmer font</h2>

The <strong>Busra</strong> font family is the latest version of the popular Khmer Busra font first released as part of the <a href="https://software.sil.org/mondulkiri/">Mondulkiri project</a>. This Khmer font has been improved and updated for a wide range of uses, from print to web, and to support the latest Khmer text encoding best practices.

There are now six weights in the Busra family: ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold. This new range of weights replaces the lighter weight Khmer Mondulkiri font family. Webfonts in both WOFF and WOFF2 formats are provided for use on websites and in applications built on web technologies. Font file sizes have been dramatically reduced: the OpenType (.ttf) fonts are less than one fifth the size of Khmer Busra, and the WOFF2 versions are compressed to only 7% of the former size.

The fonts also conform to the latest Khmer Encoding Structure specification (<a href=”https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn61”>Unicode Technical Note #61</a>). This encoding prevents ambiguity and ensures that any given visual form has only one encoding, which will improve text portability between technical platforms.

The family is named after the Bou Sra waterfall in Mondulkiri Province. It supports most of the Cambodian languages written in the Khmer script.
