title: Busra - Version History
fontversion: 9.000

Busra is based on a font that was part of a larger package of Khmer script fonts called Mondulkiri; the earliest form of Busra was called "Khmer Mondulkiri book." Significant changes exist between the earlier fonts and this Busra release; a few of these are:

- The font supports a new Khmer encoding structure; see [Khmer Encoding Structure](../assets/pdfs/KhmerEncodingStructure.pdf).
- There is no longer support for Apple's AAT technology.
- The Latin has been completely redesigned.
