(Release of Busra v9.000 (Khmer script fonts))
(Release 9.000)

Dear friends,

We're pleased to announce the release of Busra version 9.000â€”a newly updated version of the Khmer Busra font formerly part of the Mondulkiri project. There have been major changes since version 7.100:

- The font family is now called "Busra" so it and the old "Khmer Busra" can be installed at the same time.
- There are six weights: ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold. This also replaces the older Khmer Mondulkiri family.
- Oblique (italic) styles are not included but will be provided in a later release.
- Glyph outlines have been revised and improved.
- OpenType support has been rewritten, supporting latest best practice in Khmer text encoding.
- Support for Graphite and AAT rendering has been removed.
- Latin glyphs have been replaced with ones specifically designed to work well with the Khmer glyphs. 
- Default line spacing has updated to best practice. This could affect older Windows apps.
- Three font formats are provided: OpenType (.ttf) for desktop use and WOFF/WOFF2 for the web.

Busra is available from the Busra Download Page  (https://software.sil.org/busra/download/)
