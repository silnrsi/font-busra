The Busra fonts provide Unicode support for languages and writing systems that use the Khmer script. The design is based on the Khmer Mondulkiri family of fonts (https://software.sil.org/mondulkiri/), but with significant updates to the design and rendering behavior.

The current beta test release (Busra Test B) includes Regular and Bold weights and can be downloaded from the [project releases page](https://github.com/silnrsi/font-busra/releases). Additional weights are planned for future releases.
