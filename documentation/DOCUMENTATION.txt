DOCUMENTATION
Busra
========================

The documentation for this project is listed in index.html.

There are also PDF versions of these files in the `pdf` folder.

Some of these html files assume the Busra font is available in the
`../web/` folder. This will be the case if you have downloaded and unpacked 
the released font product zip. However, if you have cloned the source repo 
from GitHub this will not be the case, and you should view the PDFs instead.

Developer notes:

These html and pdf files are produced from markdown sources (in `source`) using pandoc,
weasyprint, and custom python scripts. See the `makedocs` shell script
in the main project folder.
